White Knight Belt Printer
This repository contains all files necessary to build you own White Knight Belt printer..
Please bear with me as I continue to update files and process assembly videos

Please see issue #7 if you wish to help convert the .STL files to fusion 360 files. To make sure multiple people aren't working on the same file we are claiming them one by one. 

Once you have a file converted, please make a push request for both a .F3D and .STEP files to the fusion 360 folder in the development branch. This is so the parts can be tested before being moved to the master branch.
